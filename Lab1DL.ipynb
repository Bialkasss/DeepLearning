It's not differentiable and some algorithms for optimization require the loss function to be differentiable. That's why we will use the so-called mean squared error $(prediction - y)^2$.

    "Selecting the best number of layers and neurons is an optimization task itself. There are no strict rules.

    "Lifehack: since selecting architecture is an optimization task we can use an optimization algorithm to solve it. The most obvious representation would be a vector of size equal to the maximum number of layers we want and each element representing the number of neurons in such a layer. There are a few problems with this approach - it doesn't make sense to have neurons in the next layer if we have 0 neurons in the previous which is allowed in this representation. Removing 0 from the considered range is an option but then we will fix the number of layers. Also in most cases, it's not recommended to increase the number of neurons in the next layer. To avoid these issues we can change the representation. The first element will still be the number of neurons in the first layer, but all remainings will be the number from 0 to 1 meaning the fraction of neurons from the previous layer used in this layer. For example $[64, 1, .5, .5, 0, 0]$ would mean architecture with 4 layers with 64, 64, 32, and 16 neurons."
